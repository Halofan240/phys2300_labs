# Declare arras to hold the masses, initial positions, and initial velocities of the particles
# Determine the initial values (get from user)
# Determine the timestep, and how long the user wants the simulation to run
# for each timestep:
#     for each particle:
#         for all the other particles
#         * Compute the acceleration due to gravity
#         * Use the acceleration to compute the change in velocity
#         * Use the velocity to compute the change in position
#         * Add the changes in acceleration, velocity and position to the particle's current values
#         * Report
# End the program when simulation is complete
